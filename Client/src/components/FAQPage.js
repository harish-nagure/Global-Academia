          answer: 'This will depend on whether or not your student visa allows you to work. In some countries there are restrictions on the amount of paid work you can undertake during your studies. Often there’s a limit of 20 hours’ paid work per week during term time, with full-time work permitted during holidays.If you don’t need a student visa, it is more likely you’ll be able to work as many hours as you like, as long as this doesn’t affect your studies – but check with the university and/or official government site. If you do work during your studies, it’s not a good idea to rely on your wages to fund living costs, and in many cases you’ll need to prove you already have enough money to support yourself when you apply for your visa.'
